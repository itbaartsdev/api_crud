# Input Date Field and Date Range Filter Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Database Table Changes (proses.php)
- **Added automatic `input_date` field** to every new table created
- Field type: `DATETIME` with `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- This field automatically records when each record is inserted

### 2. Laporan (Report) System Enhancements

#### A. Date Range Filter UI (header.php)
- Added date filter form with:
  - "Dari Tanggal" (From Date) input
  - "Sampai Tanggal" (To Date) input  
  - Filter button to apply filters
  - Reset button to clear filters
- Filter form appears at the top of every report

#### B. SQL Query Enhancement (isi.php)
- Modified SQL query to include WHERE conditions for date filtering
- Filters based on `DATE(input_date)` to match selected date range
- Added `ORDER BY input_date DESC` for newest records first
- Supports single date or date range filtering

#### C. Table Headers (judul.php)
- Added "Tanggal Input" column header to all reports
- Automatically added after all user-defined fields

#### D. Data Display (ulang.php)
- Added `input_date` data display in reports
- Format: "dd/mm/yyyy HH:mm" (e.g., "04/09/2025 14:30")
- Shows in the last column of every report

## How It Works

### For Table Creation:
1. User creates a new table through the form
2. System automatically adds `input_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` field
3. Every new record will automatically have the current timestamp

### For Reports:
1. User accesses any report page
2. Date filter form is displayed at the top
3. User can:
   - Select "From Date" only (shows records from that date onward)
   - Select "To Date" only (shows records up to that date)
   - Select both (shows records within date range)
   - Click "Reset" to show all records
4. Report shows filtered data with timestamps

## Example Usage

### Creating Table:
```sql
-- When user creates "barang" table, system automatically adds:
ALTER TABLE barang ADD input_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

### Report Filtering:
```sql
-- Filter from 2025-09-01 to 2025-09-30:
SELECT * FROM barang 
WHERE DATE(input_date) >= '2025-09-01' 
AND DATE(input_date) <= '2025-09-30' 
ORDER BY input_date DESC;
```

## Files Modified:
1. `/azzam/proses.php` - Added automatic input_date field creation
2. `/data/laporan/header.php` - Added date filter UI
3. `/data/laporan/isi.php` - Added date filtering SQL logic
